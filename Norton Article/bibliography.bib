	abstract = {The stress ensemble has advantages for studying shear flow in highly viscous media. We derive a simple method for performing nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in this ensemble. We also derive the associated equilibrium fluctuation expressions for the zero frequency shear viscosity. These expressions relate the reciprocal of the shear viscosity to strain rate fluctuations in the zero stress equilibrium ensemble. Our analysis is based upon the Nosé-Hoover method of treating non-holonomic constraints. We show that for generating the stress ensemble, the Nosé-Hoover method is much simpler to implement than the corresponding gaussian approach.},

The discovery of fluctuation theorems as a fundamental structure common to almost all non-equilibrium systems, and the connections with the free energy calculation methods of Jarzynski and Crooks, have excited both theorists and experimentalists. This graduate-level book charts the development and theoretical analysis of molecular dynamics as applied to equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Designed for both researchers in the field and graduate students of physics, it connects molecular dynamics simulation with the mathematical theory to understand non-equilibrium steady states. It also provides a link between the atomic, nano, and macro worlds. The book ends with an introduction to the use of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to justify a thermodynamic treatment of non-equilibrium steady states, and gives a direction to further avenues of exploration.},

The results are interpreted in terms of a modified hard-sphere model and it is shown that the Lennard-Jones fluid obeys a Stokes-type relation in which the effective molecular diameter is close to that deduced from equilibrium structural properties.},

In the hyperbolic scaling, a nontrivial average velocity can be observed even if the external forcing vanishes in average. More surprisingly, an average velocity in the direction opposite to the forcing may develop at the linear response level—a phenomenon called negative mobility. The diffusive limit of the non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics is also studied using the general methodology of central limit theorems for additive functionals of Markov processes. To apply this methodology, which is based on the study of appropriate Poisson equations, we extend recent results on pointwise estimates of the resolvent of the generator associated with the Langevin dynamics. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional system.},

The resulting estimator is the product of a time average and a martingale correlated to this time average. We investigate both its discretization and finite-time approximation errors. The designed numerical schemes are shown to be of a bounded variance with respect to the integration time which is desirable feature for long time simulations.
